ONLINE CAMPUS APP TRIAL README
Hello, my name is Will and this is my project. It is a small online campust app that opens up with a login screen where it gives you the ability to login into the app itself. The login and the sign up data is hosted on firebase. So once you're on the login screen, you first enter your email and your password.

If you have already registered an account, you will be able to move to the main screen which will show you all of the available units that are there which you can click on and see the content available. If you do not yet have an account, you will not be able to be moved to the next screen where this is where you will now navigate to the sign up button at the bottom of the login section where you will sign up your credentials: your email and your password. So once you sign up, it will automatically push you to the screen with the units available and that data is then saved.

When you come back next time, let's say you close the app and you reopen it, you will be in the database already so when you use the credentials you signed up with previously, you will be able to access the online campus and all the units available. This is a small app, basically does a login function and has interactive buttons but yeah hopefully in the future I want to add menus, more content, background pictures or colors and make a whole app out of that. So yeah, this is the project.

Thank you
